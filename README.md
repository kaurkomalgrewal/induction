## ðŸ•˜ 9:00 AM â€“ 11:00 AM  
*Expert Lecture by Dr. Jaswinder Singh (Incharge - APT)*  

They spoke about their life experiences with honesty and clarity, offering us a meaningful perspective on how to navigate challenges and grow. One of the key messages they shared was the importance of learning practical skills and constantly improving ourselves. They reminded us that so much depends on how we see thingsâ€”our vision shapes our path. What stood out to me most was not just what they said, but how they said itâ€”their words were inspiring and sincere. They also brought science to life through simple, engaging experiments, making complex ideas easier to understand and enjoy.
